# üåø Plant Nursery Inventory and Environmental Management System Design

This repository serves as the **System Implementation Report and Design Portfolio** for a comprehensive database system designed to modernize operations for a plant nursery.

The project focused on replacing an outdated manual system with a centralized digital platform that integrates crucial business functions: Inventory, Biodiversity Tracking, and Environmental Sustainability.

## üåü Skills Demonstrated

This portfolio demonstrates proficiency in the following areas:

* **Database Design:** Conceptual, Logical, and Physical Database Modeling (Entity-Relationship Model (ERM), Schema Design).
* **System Analysis:** Requirements gathering, problem identification, defining business rules, and mapping system flows.
* **UI/UX Prototyping:** Designing practical and intuitive user interfaces for all major system modules.
* **Business Reporting:** Documenting system functionality, technical specifications, and user interaction.

## üöÄ System Functionality Overview

The proposed system is structured around four main modules, each designed to manage a critical area of the nursery's operations.

### 1. Inventory Management Module

* **Goal:** Centralized tracking of all nursery stock.
* **Key Data Points:** Tracks **Plant Name, Quantity, Price, Location,** and **Supplier Information**.

### 2. Biodiversity Tracking Module

* **Goal:** Monitoring and recording plant health and environmental conditions crucial for biodiversity preservation.
* **Key Function:** Provides tools for administrators to manage and analyze plant health metrics.
